    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in El Salvador but moved to the United States when I was 4 years old. <br>
        I grew up in the northern Virgina and after graduating high school I moved down <br>
        to Texas. Once in Texas I attened San Jacinto College and completed 2 years there. <br>
        Afterwards, I joined the Marine Corps reserves and after completing my military <br>
        training transfered to Texas A&M. With my bachelors degree I was able to secure <br>
        a job with an envirometal service company as a Technical Service Representative. <br>

    <h2> Why I want to become a web developer?</h2>
      <p>
        I want to become a web developer because it involves a good mixture of technology, <br>
        creativity, and prblem solving. I've always had an intrest in the  technology, frequently <br>
        visiting sites like cnet and Macworld when I was in middle school. Reading and watching <br>
         videos on tech grew my interest even further. My junior year of high school  I took a <br>
        programing class and I instantly knew It was something that I would be intrested in. I hope <br> 
         learning web development will open the doors, so that one day I will be working on <br>
        the latest and greatest technology. <br>
      </p>
